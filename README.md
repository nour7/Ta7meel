Xamarin Youtube downloader sample app.
This is simple Xamarin mobile app that uses [libvideo plugin] (https://github.com/jamesqo/libvideo) to download Youtube videos.

This app was never meant to be published but rather was part of Xamarin learning process.

Please note, it is illegal to publish this app on Play Market (and maybe App Store!). **_I take no responsbility at all_**.
